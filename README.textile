h1. Sunlight Labs API Gem

h2. Description

A little gem that integrates with the Sunlight Labs API. From the "official site":http://services.sunlightlabs.com/api/:

bq. The Sunlight Labs API provides methods for obtaining basic information on Members of Congress, legislator IDs used by various websites, and lookups between places and the politicians that represent them. The primary purpose of the API is to facilitate mashups involving politicians and the various other APIs that are out there.

Full API documentation available "here":http://services.sunlightlabs.com/api/docs/. 

Optionally, the Sunlight gem integrates with the Google Maps API for "street address geocoding":http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/services.html#Geocoding. Because some zip codes overlap two or more congressional districts, passing in a latitude/longitude will give users the most accurate information. Since it's highly unlikely a user would know their exact lat/lng, the Google Maps API is used to translate a street address string into a lat/lng pair.


h2. Installation

The following gems are required:

* json
* ym4r

@$ sudo gem install json ym4r@
